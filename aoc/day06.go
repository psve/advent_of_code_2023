--- Day 6: Wait For It ---

The ferry quickly brings you across Island Island. After asking around, you discover
that there is indeed normally a large pile of sand somewhere near here, but you don't
see anything besides lots of water and the small island where the ferry has docked.

As you try to figure out what to do next, you notice a poster on a wall near the ferry
dock. "Boat races! Open to the public! Grand prize is an all-expenses-paid trip to
Desert Island!" That must be where the sand comes from! Best of all, the boat races are
starting in just a few minutes.

You manage to sign up as a competitor in the boat races just in time. The organizer
explains that it's not really a traditional race - instead, you will get a fixed amount
of time during which your boat has to travel as far as it can, and you win if your boat
goes the farthest.

As part of signing up, you get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the time
allowed for each race and also the best distance ever recorded in that race. To
guarantee you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you go farther in each race
than the current record holder.

The organizer brings you over to the area where the boat races are held. The boats are
much smaller than you expected - they're actually toy boats, each with a big button on
top. Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the boat
to move. Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the
button counts against the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of
the race, and boats don't move until the button is released.

For example:

Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200

This document describes three races:

  - The first race lasts 7 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 9
    millimeters.
  - The second race lasts 15 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 40
    millimeters.
  - The third race lasts 30 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 200
    millimeters.

Your toy boat has a starting speed of zeroTime:        56     71     79     99
Distance:   334   1135   1350   2430

	millimeters per millisecond. For each whole

millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button, the boat's
speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.

So, because the first race lasts 7 milliseconds, you only have a few options:

  - Don't hold the button at all (that is, hold it for 0 milliseconds) at the start of the
    race. The boat won't move; it will have traveled 0 millimeters by the end of the race.
  - Hold the button for 1 millisecond at the start of the race. Then, the boat will travel
    at a speed of 1 millimeter per millisecond for 6 milliseconds, reaching a total
    distance traveled of 6 millimeters.
  - Hold the button for 2 milliseconds, giving the boat a speed of 2 millimeters per
    millisecond. It will then get 5 milliseconds to move, reaching a total distance of 10
    millimeters.
  - Hold the button for 3 milliseconds. After its remaining 4 milliseconds of travel time,
    the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.
  - Hold the button for 4 milliseconds. After its remaining 3 milliseconds of travel time,
    the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.
  - Hold the button for 5 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 10
    millimeters.
  - Hold the button for 6 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 6
    millimeters.
  - Hold the button for 7 milliseconds. That's the entire duration of the race. You never
    let go of the button. The boat can't move until you let go of the button. Please make
    sure you let go of the button so the boat gets to move. 0 millimeters.

Since the current record for this race is 9 millimeters, there are actually 4 different
ways you could win: you could hold the button for 2, 3, 4, or 5 milliseconds at the
start of the race.

In the second race, you could hold the button for at least 4 milliseconds and at most 11
milliseconds and beat the record, a total of 8 different ways to win.

In the third race, you could hold the button for at least 11 milliseconds and no more
than 19 milliseconds and still beat the record, a total of 9 ways you could win.

To see how much margin of error you have, determine the number of ways you can beat the
record in each race; in this example, if you multiply these values together, you get 288
(4 * 8 * 9).

Determine the number of ways you could beat the record in each race. What do you get if
you multiply these numbers together?

/*
--- Part Two ---

As the race is about to start, you realize the piece of paper with race times and record
distances you got earlier actually just has very bad kerning. There's really only one
race - ignore the spaces between the numbers on each line.

So, the example from before:

Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200

...now instead means this:

Time:      71530
Distance:  940200

Now, you have to figure out how many ways there are to win this single race. In this
example, the race lasts for 71530 milliseconds and the record distance you need to beat
is 940200 millimeters. You could hold the button anywhere from 14 to 71516 milliseconds
and beat the record, a total of 71503 ways!

How many ways can you beat the record in this one much longer race?
